************************************
* Release mapx-0.10  February 2010 *
************************************

* New Functionality
-------------------

Added new command-line utility, ungrid, to extract point data from a
binary gridded data file.

Added options to command-line utility, irregrid, to output total points
file and do drop-in-the-bucket averaging.

Added -F option to command_line utility, regrid, to support floating-point
data.

Added out-of-grid-bounds error checking to mapx handling of UTM
projections.

* Fixes
------------------

Modified Makefile:
- making MAPDIR directory as part of install for libmapx.a
- added target for new ungrid utility
- added CFLAGS to all command-line utilities, so compilation switches are consistent
- added -fPIC to the compilation to allow shared objects that link to this
  library to work properly

Modified INSTALL with note about where to get sample .mpp/.gpd files.

Added 64-bit types to define.h.  Used 'NSIDC' prefix to avoid collisions
 with HDF library types.

Removed the sincos function from proj.h/cproj.c.  Beginning with
optimizations introduced in gcc 4.3.1, this was causing a segfault, most
obviously in gtest, but would have occurred anytime the optimization was
invoked.  Apparently the existence of our own sincos function was
resulting in optimizations that set up infinite recursion.  We are
removing our local copy, so that optimizations will be implemented
properly.

Added dummy variables to mapx structure to work around compiler/debugger
problem that wasn't aligning structure elements properly for the debugger.

New file, mapx-poster.ppt is a powerpoint file with poster describing mapx.

New revision of ppgc.html, with standardized html formatting and clarified
content.

NSIDC switched internal revision control from CVS to Subversion, where
keyword substitution is handled differently.  Header keyword was changed
to Id.  Value of file revisions now reflects Subversion repository
revisions.
