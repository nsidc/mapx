This is the Notes file for mapx.

Refer to NSIDC Best Practices document at 
http://newice.colorado.edu:8000/intranet/GROUPS/PROGRAMMERS/best_practices.html
for guidelines and thoughts about what standard files to include, and
details about how to accomplish any of the following steps.

To make a release of mapx, you need to do these steps

* make sure all changes have been checked into the repository

* update mapx.notes and ReleaseNotes with the changes from the last
  release to this one.  See best_practices.html.

* Once you have documented the release and decided which files to include,
  add the new tag to the release versions of the files.  See
  best_practices.html for details.

* Now, checkout mapx from cvs to a clean directory 

~/tmp/production> cvs co -r TAG_NAME mapx
~/tmp/production> cd mapx
~/tmp/production/mapx> make tar

  There may be files that should not be included in a release.  At the
  very least this includes mapx.notes, which is for internal project
  tracking.  Removed these prior to making the tarball.

* move the tarball into a directory that corresponds to the curent release
  number.

~/tmp/production/mapx> mkdir ../mapx-0.0
~/tmp/production/mapx> mv mapx.tar.gz ../mapx-0.0

*  Untar the tarball, and remove it.

~/tmp/production/mapx-0.0> tar zxvf mapx.tar.gz
~/tmp/production/mapx-0.0> rm mapx.tar.gz

* go up a directory and create the new correctly named tarball.

~/tmp/production/mapx-0.0> cd ..
~/tmp/production> tar cvf mapx-0.0.tar mapx-0.0/

Ship the tarball to whomever gets it.

Considering issuing mapx-0.10.  Main compelling reason is updated define.h
for 64-bit machines, and so we can release a new pmsdt.

Summary of changes:

* New Functions:

-) New command-line utility, ungrid, extracts point data from a binary
 gridded data file.

-) New options to irregrid, to output total points file, and do
 drop-in-the-bucket weighting.

-) New option to regrid, added -F option to support floating-point data

* Fixes

-) Makefile
   - making MAPDIR directory as part of install for libmapx.a
   - added target for new ungrid utility
   - added CFLAGS to all command-line utilities, so compilation switches are consistent
   - added -fPIC to the compilation to allow shared objects that link to this
     library to work properly

-) INSTALL
   - Added note about where to get sample .mpp/.gpd files
   
-) Added 64-bit types to define.h.  Used 'NSIDC' prefix to avoid
 collisions with HDF library types.

-) Removed the sincos function from proj.h/cproj.c.  Beginning with
optimizations introduced in gcc 4.3.1, this was causing a segfault, most
obviously in gtest, but would have occurred anytime the optimization was
invoked.  Apparently the existence of our own sincos function was
resulting in optimizations that set up infinite recursion.  We are
removing our local copy, so that optimizations will be implemented
properly.

-) Changes to mapx.h/mapx.c:

added include isin.h
added forward_xy_mapx_check and inverse_xy_mapx_check
added dist_latlon_map_units and dist_xy_map_units
added Map Maximum Error
made default eccentricity = 0 for spherical projections
added setting the flattening in reinit_mapx
added call to forward_xy_mapx_check in forward_mapx and forward_xy_mapx
added call to inverse_xy_mapx_check in inverse_mapx and inverse_xy_mapx

-) mapx.h:

added maximum_error to mapx structure
added dummy variables to mapx structure to work around compiler/debugger
problem

--> need to get Terry to explain what these changes are for

-) New file, mapx-poster.ppt -  Powerpoint file with poster describing mapx.

-) New revision of ppgc.html - standardized html formatting, clarified
 content.

xx) unit_test changes -- note sent to Terry about this, today

Stuff to remove prior to tarball (the tar target in the Makefile looks
like it already omits these):

.svn directory - housekeeping, no need to release
mapx.notes - internal project notes
Makefile.ms2gt -
               no -fPIC in CONFIG_CFLAGS, and a little out-of-date with Makefile;
               no need to distribute this copy.
README-UTMupgrade -
               extensive notes from Terry on changes made in 2003-2004; it looks to me
               like these were all included in mapx-0.9
README-cdb -
           Ken's notes on the cdb (CIA database) stuff.  No need to distribute.


A copy of ReleaseNotes should not be included in the tarball, but put it on the FTP site.
Find and change all CVS keywords, tell svn to do substitution:

svn propset svn:keywords "Id Revision" weather.txt

Possible keywords: Date Revision Author HeadURL Id

Do a final check to ensure no references to define64.h
